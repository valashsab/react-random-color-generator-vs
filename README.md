# React Random Color Generator

A button with the exact text Generate will cause a new color to be generated when it is clicked

Once a color is generated, update the background color of a div which contains the exact text Generated Color: <background color hex code> (the background color and the hex code must match)

An input field provided asks for a hue and luminosity, which should be then assigned to the background color of the div container.
